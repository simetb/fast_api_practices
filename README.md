# FastAPI Practice Repository

This repository is focused on practicing and developing with FastAPI modules as specified in its documentation [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/es/tutorial/bigger-applications/).

## Overview

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of standard Python type hints, which allows for great editor support and easy integration with tools like Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

This repository contains examples, exercises, and projects aimed at helping developers become proficient in building larger applications using FastAPI.
